### Uploading Images

To upload images to a directory, first select the directory by clicking on its name in the list on the left side of the screen. Then, click on the "Upload Images" button in the top right corner of the screen. Select one or more image files from your computer and click "Upload". The images will be added to the selected directory.

### Moving Images

To move an image from one directory to another, first select the directory containing the image by clicking on its name in the list on the left side of the screen. Then, click on the image to select it. Click on the "Move Image" button in the top right corner of the screen. Select the destination directory from the dropdown menu and click "Move".

### Deleting Directories and Images

To delete a directory or image, first select it by clicking on its name in the list on the left side of the screen. Then, click on the "Delete" button in the top right corner of the screen. Confirm that you want to delete the directory or image.

## Additional Features

### Roles and Permissions

SimPic has plans to implement further roles and permissions.

### Performance

The performance loading pages with directories is not affected by a larger amount of images inside, because those images will load dynamically. It only can last several seconds to upload multiple files inside the application, as of course they have to be transmitted over the internet and stored in the database.
